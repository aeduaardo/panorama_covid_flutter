## 📋 About the project

The project in question is an application developed in the Dart languague and entitled **PANORAMA COVID-19** which brings a simple proposal: to gather in one place the information about COVID-19 in Brazil and in the world, in a simple and intuitive way.



## 💪🏼 Motivation

The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus is a topic on all the news in the world, but I have not found any application that would provide information clearly about the cases in Brazil and in the world. Thus, this project was conceived in order to develop an application that would deliver this information to the user.


## 🛸 Technologies
The application was developed with the following technologies:

* 🛠  [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
* ⚙️ [Slidy](https://github.com/Flutterando/slidy)
* 💎 [Flutter Modular](https://github.com/Flutterando/modular)
* 🛢 [Mobx](https://pub.dev/packages/mobx)
 

## 💡 Layout
The application layout was conceived creating a mental concept, mixing various UI's influences available on the website [**Dribbble**](https://dribbble.com/) and throughout the project, all credits are directed to the  [**Freepik**](https://www.freepik.com/) website, which provides free vectors to be used, as can be seen by accessing the logo link used in the project, clicking [**HERE**](https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/coronavirus-logo-concept_7607473.htm#page=1&query=covid-19%20logo&position=24).



## 📊 What information does the application provide? 
As a whole the project presents 4 information about COVID-19:

* 😷 Confirmed cases 
* 🥳 Recovered
* 💀 Confirmed deaths
* ☣️ Percentage of infected population  

This information is available in 02 (two) different panoramas: **National** and **World**.

#### 🌴 NATIONAL PANORAMA
It presents the information cited for Brazil and all its states.  

#### 🌍 WORLD PANORAMA
It presents the information mentioned for all cases in the world and also presents the **RANKING COVID - TOP 20**, which brings the 20 (twenty) countries with the highest number of cases of the new coronavirus.
